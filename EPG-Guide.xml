Ziggo TopSport is het nieuwe programma van Ziggo Sport over de Nederlandse sport. We hebben bijna in elke sport wereldtoppers en ze doen overal mee om de hoofdprijzen. Op Ziggo Sport geven we al die sterren het grote podium dat ze verdienen om hun verhaal te vertellen. Hoe groot zijn hun opofferingen? Waaruit halen zij hun plezier? Hoe gaan ze om met verlies? Met stress en spanningen? Waar en wanneer is het zaadje voor hun passie ooit geplant? Elke week gaat Frank Evenblij aan de hand van bijzondere fragmenten in gesprek met een topsporter en kijken volleybalsters Knip &amp; Plak of ze ook talent hebben voor een andere sport. Iedere uitzending vertelt een voetballer ons welke internationale ster hij bewondert, maken we kennis met een spectaculaire olympische sport, proberen sporters met hun hersenen een Formule 1-auto te laten bewegen en sluiten handbalsters Estavana Polman &amp; Tess Wester af met een duivels dilemma</desc>

Ziggo TopSport is het nieuwe programma van Ziggo Sport over de Nederlandse sport. We hebben bijna in elke sport wereldtoppers en ze doen overal mee om de hoofdprijzen. Op Ziggo Sport geven we al die sterren het grote podium dat ze verdienen om hun verhaal te vertellen. Hoe groot zijn hun opofferingen? Waaruit halen zij hun plezier? Hoe gaan ze om met verlies? Met stress en spanningen? Waar en wanneer is het zaadje voor hun passie ooit geplant? Elke week gaat Frank Evenblij aan de hand van bijzondere fragmenten in gesprek met een topsporter en kijken volleybalsters Knip &amp; Plak of ze ook talent hebben voor een andere sport. Iedere uitzending vertelt een voetballer ons welke internationale ster hij bewondert, maken we kennis met een spectaculaire olympische sport, proberen sporters met hun hersenen een Formule 1-auto te laten bewegen en sluiten handbalsters Estavana Polman &amp; Tess Wester af met een duivels dilemma</desc>
