<desc lang="en">When the dolphin mascot of Miami's NFL team is abducted, Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey), a zany private investigator who specializes in finding missing animals, looks into the case. Soon Miami Dolphins players are kidnapped too, including star player Dan Marino (Dan Marino), making Ace's sleuth work even more pressing.

They track the drugs to a Cuban smuggler, Johnny Tapia (Jordi Mollà), who is also involved in a bloody war with Russian and Haitian mobsters. If that isn't bad enough, there's tension between the two cops because Lowrey is romantically involved with Burnett's sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union).</desc>

<desc lang="pt-BR">Acompanhe esse teste de conhecimento, raciocínio rápido e trabalho em equipe. Dois times, cada um formado por uma celebridade e um participante, competem numa divertida e emocionante disputa para mostrar quem tem o melhor vocabulário. Na primeira etapa do jogo - composto de quatro rodadas eliminatórias - um dos membros da dupla dá dicas para que o outro descubra qual é a palavra secreta (a mega senha) daquela rodada. O participante que acertar o maior número de palavras ao final das rodadas eliminatórias passa para a etapa seguinte. A segunda etapa do jogo consiste de seis rodadas, nas quais a dupla precisa acertar cinco mega senhas em um minuto e meio. A cada rodada, o desafio fica maior, já que o número de mega senhas vai diminuindo. Se no primeiro round o time precisa acertar cinco mega senhas dentre dez disponíveis, no sexto e último round - valendo o prêmio máximo do programa - são apenas cinco palavras disponíveis e todas tem que ser adivinhadas corretamente.</desc>

<desc lang="en">It's been years since Chucky, the doll with the soul and the voice (Brad Dourif) of a psychopathic killer, was apparently destroyed in a fire at a doll factory. Now Chucky's manufacturer is remaking the same line of toys with the old, still haunted materials. This resurrects Chucky, who goes after Andy (Justin Whalin), his former owner, who now attends military school. Chucky slashes his way through a string of grotesque murders as Andy tries to stop the homicidal doll and the spirit within it.</desc>
