One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one.

<desc lang="en">This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

<desc lang="en">This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

<title lang="en" >Card Sharks</title>
<desc lang="en">This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

<desc lang="en">Just about everybody likes animals and doesn't like to see animals who are sick, injured or abused. So "Animal Rescue," a weekly series -- aimed at children and families -- that showcases spectacular rescues of animals, should be very popular. Because people don't like to see an animal's situation get so bad that it requires rescue, the program tries to avoid those situations by instructing children on the proper care of animals, as well as giving safety tips on caring for all types of creatures.</desc>

Unfortunately, Aladeen has a less-than-friendly reception from exiled Wadiyans, who want their country freed from his despotic rule.</desc>

Ziggo TopSport is het nieuwe programma van Ziggo Sport over de Nederlandse sport. We hebben bijna in elke sport wereldtoppers en ze doen overal mee om de hoofdprijzen. Op Ziggo Sport geven we al die sterren het grote podium dat ze verdienen om hun verhaal te vertellen. Hoe groot zijn hun opofferingen? Waaruit halen zij hun plezier? Hoe gaan ze om met verlies? Met stress en spanningen? Waar en wanneer is het zaadje voor hun passie ooit geplant? Elke week gaat Frank Evenblij aan de hand van bijzondere fragmenten in gesprek met een topsporter en kijken volleybalsters Knip &amp; Plak of ze ook talent hebben voor een andere sport. Iedere uitzending vertelt een voetballer ons welke internationale ster hij bewondert, maken we kennis met een spectaculaire olympische sport, proberen sporters met hun hersenen een Formule 1-auto te laten bewegen en sluiten handbalsters Estavana Polman &amp; Tess Wester af met een duivels dilemma</desc>

Ziggo TopSport is het nieuwe programma van Ziggo Sport over de Nederlandse sport. We hebben bijna in elke sport wereldtoppers en ze doen overal mee om de hoofdprijzen. Op Ziggo Sport geven we al die sterren het grote podium dat ze verdienen om hun verhaal te vertellen. Hoe groot zijn hun opofferingen? Waaruit halen zij hun plezier? Hoe gaan ze om met verlies? Met stress en spanningen? Waar en wanneer is het zaadje voor hun passie ooit geplant? Elke week gaat Frank Evenblij aan de hand van bijzondere fragmenten in gesprek met een topsporter en kijken volleybalsters Knip &amp; Plak of ze ook talent hebben voor een andere sport. Iedere uitzending vertelt een voetballer ons welke internationale ster hij bewondert, maken we kennis met een spectaculaire olympische sport, proberen sporters met hun hersenen een Formule 1-auto te laten bewegen en sluiten handbalsters Estavana Polman &amp; Tess Wester af met een duivels dilemma</desc>
